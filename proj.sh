# Jesus is Lord and King of my life
# we are the people of the Lord the folk that is laid by his hands
# come, let us adore him
# it is the sound of Christmas and all are waiting in expectation
# time flies as we quickly move closer to christmas
# what does that potent for us?
# i think that is the question that should form our minds
